            "content_1": "Follow Greenwich Church St. north to the land locked tea clipper Cutty Sark, which used to zip back from Australia in less than 80 days; you can't miss the sight of its tall mast. Stop by the visitor's centre, hosted in the Pepys building, part of the old Naval College near the Sark. Upon exiting, take a right past the statue of George II and enter the ornate Painted Hall - its ceiling alone took 19 years to finish.",
            "content_2": "Cross Romney Road to the National Maritime Museum, then hike the path up to the Royal Observatory, where you can set your watch to Greenwich Mean Time and straddle zero longitude. In the distance you'll be able to see the expensive and contentious Millenium Dome - it's the structure that resembles an overturned Wok. Return down the path to the left of Jubilee Avenue before turning down The Avenue. To the left is the small Greenwich Royal Park Herb Garden and an exit to Croom's Hill, where at #12 stands the strangely fascinating Fan Museum.",
            "content_3": "Follow Croom's Hill, and at the corner duck into Spread Eagle (8-9 Nevada), a bookshop brimming with odd English curios. Continue on Greenwich High Rd. A right on narrow Turnpin Lane leads into Greenwich market, a trading place for hungry mariners since 1737. A left on College Approach leads to Greenwich Church St. AT #45 is the secret jewel of Greenwich, Goddard's Pie House, the cheapest and best place for the traditional British dish of peas and mash (mashed potatoes). It's a must for those who want authentic English cuisine. The DLR Station is a few feer away, but a better way back to the city is to cruise on the riverboats that depart down near the Cutty Sark. The boats are clearly marked.",
